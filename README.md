# Hey-Day
In this small project, you can enter your name, and get an output with a Hey and your name.

### More about Hey-Day:
The tradition goes back to World War II, where the students wanted to welcome the returning soldiers.

Each year we carry on this tradition of handing out name tags and encouraging students, faculty, and the rest of the Auburn Family to greet one another with the Auburn Spirit in an effort to bring all those part of Auburn closer together. HEY DAY has become one of Auburn Universityâ€™s longest and most cherished traditions and is a day the student body has grown to love and look forward to each year.
